# Getting Started and First Concepts

<!-- -->

1.  ** What Counts as a Historical Document?** MinDoc publishes
    historical documents.  But what counts as a historical document? In
    theory, pretty much anything. Any artifact or object--whether it's a
    text, a picture, film, a sound, a rock, a classroom chair with
    initials carved in it--could tell someone something about the past
    it came from. If you have something that you think can help people
    understand history better, and you want to share it online, then
    MinDoc can help you publish it.

2.  ** What Makes This a 'Documentary Edition'?** An edition is a
    presentation of something: a publication, something you put out into
    the world (or in this case, online). A *documentary* edition
    (sometimes called a historical edition) is publication that presents
    an artifact (or artifacts) as it existed (or exists) in the world,
    so that it can be used to explore the past. In other words, the goal
    isn't to present the *best* version of something, or the one that is
    somehow *truest* to someone's ideal version---it\'s not a revised
    novel or a Director's Cut.  A documentary edition seeks to present
    readers with a published version of an actual document as it is, so
    they can use it as a source of information about a moment in time. 
    People publish documents for a number of
    [[reasons]{.underline}](https://elaboratories.org/courses/why-edit/):
    to help a history be more widely known or studied; to make it more
    accessible; to enter it into the public record so it can be cited;
    to preserve it.  The Association for Documentary Editing
    [[defines]{.underline}](https://www.documentaryediting.org/wordpress/?page_id=508)
    a digital documentary edition as an electronic publication of
    "primary source material prepared with 1) rigorous attention to the
    text, 2) explanatory annotation and 3) an explanation of the
    editorial practices used on the texts." Our template is designed to
    help you create a documentary edition that meets these
    standards.** **

3.  **How Do I Get a Digital Copy of My Source? ** One thing you'll need
    is the ability to create a digital copy (file) of your source.
    MinDoc doesn't digitize things or make copies for you. But chances
    are you already make digital copies of things all the time, using
    your phone's camera or an audio or video recording app.  Most
    cameras, printers, and copiers can be used to create digital images
    of things; many public libraries have scanners as well.  To create
    typeset versions (transcriptions) of texts, you can also type them
    into a word processor, thereby making a digital file (and that's
    also 'digitization!').  We discuss this process in more detail
    below.

4.  **Do I Have to Worry About Copyright?** Yes. MinDoc can't solve
    copyright questions for you.  To determine whether you have the
    right to publish something, you'll need to do your own evaluation.
    Many things are in the public domain and can be freely used,
    however, and many other things may be publishable by making a 'Fair
    Use' claim.  For a guide to evaluating what your options may be
    under U.S. Copyright law, see the [[Fair Use (FAQ) \| U.S. Copyright
    Office]{.underline}](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-fairuse.html).  
    We also highly recommend Neel Agrawal's great course on securing
    permissions, freely available through the
    [[eLaboratories]{.underline}](https://elaboratories.org/courses/securing-permissions/)
    website.

5.  **What Else Should I Be Thinking About?** Just because we can
    publish things, doesn't mean that we should.  Questions of legal
    ownership and copyright are important, but they're not the end of
    the conversation.  Is there someone else -- a person, a community --
    whose permission or opinion about this you should seek?  Do you feel
    good ethically and morally about publishing this material?  Although
    it's hard to make a definitive list of everything you might want to
    think about, take a moment to reflect on questions outside
    copyright.  If you want some examples of things you might want to
    think about, here's a list.
